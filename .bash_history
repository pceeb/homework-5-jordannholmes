#To delete the species without a full taxonomy breakdown, we uploaded the README_Week7_Data.txt file to GitHub to view the data.

We followed this same step to find the number of lines with single ';' characters, the written 'NA', and just blank spaces.
#We returned to README_Week7_Data.txt file and deleted the lines with the ';;' character present, single ';' character present, 'NA' present, and blank spaces present  using the command...

#This command will take out the single semicolons and replace them with tabs, to create the space in between each column.

#Went to first line of the text file, which provides the titles for each column of data. Added the terms Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species, all of which were separated by tabs.
#This was done manually instead of using a command. We did this to ensure the titles were were correctly placed over the corresponding data and to save time.
#This completes the first part of our Final Project as the data is properly organized with incomplete data eliminated.
