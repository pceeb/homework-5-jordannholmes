# Zebra <br>
***Equus Quagg*** <br>
   + The primary purpose for their black and white stripes is for camouflage. <br>
   + They eat leaves and grass. Zebras cannot survive without water, and they have to drink it at least once a day. <br>
   + If a zebra is wounded, its family will always come to its defense circling the injured zebra and trying to drive off any predators. <br>
   + Zebras are responsible for more injuries to United States zookeepers than any other animal. <br>
   + Zebras combine their speed with zig-zagging motions and excellent stamina to try and escape predators which chase them. <br>
   + Zebras and ostriches usually live together to protect one another from the predators. <br>
