Question 1: 

Question 2: We will be provided eDNA sequences from a sample of sea water from Zach Gold's lab. This eDNA data will be analyzed to determine what species has passed through this specific sample of sea water. 
	    We will also be provided additional data that expresses a varible of the species that were found to travel through the specific sample of sea water. This could include data pertianing to velocity, weight of fish, or estimated age of fish if I had to guess.

Question 3: We would like to collect the data, from both the eDNA results and the variable results, and insert it into a group repository.
	    From there, we will organize the eDNA to determine the species that traveled through the specific sample of sea water. After, we will organize the variable data, dependent upon the type of data (highest to lowest, alphabetical order, reverse order, etc.)
	    Then, we will analyze the data from both the eDNA data and the variable data. This will give us the proper, organized information to form a phylogenetic tree.
	    It is possible that we may include some sort of graph to depict our results.
