## Course Description
Do you have a lot of Data? Do you think you will someday generate a lot of Data? Do you want to understand programing jokes? If so this is the class for you. It is becoming easier to generate large volumes of biological data, however many biologists lack the basic skill sets to process and analyze this data. It can be daunting to figure out what to do with big data sets on your own.  

In this class, you will be introduced to fundamental skills needed for manipulation, analysis, and visualization of large data sets. You will learn how to use UNIX and learn the basics of programming and scripting in Bash (Unix shell), Python, R. This will include text file and directory manipulation, the use of regular expressions, the ability to create for loops and conditional statements, the use of functions, the ability to call other programs within programs, and much, much more. You will also learn how to run all your scripts on UCLA’s Hoffman2 Cluster. If that is not enough, you will also learn Markdown / R Markdown for document preparation. Finally, you will learn about version control using git and GitHub and generate a GitHub repository of your very own.

## How to Succeed in This Course (Expectations for Students)
If you want to succeed in this class, you must put in the time.  Programming is learned through practice and trial and error.  Programming also be frustrating, maddening, exhilarating, and at the end of a successful script or project you may feel immense satisfaction. Students in this class will succeed by finishing assignments, collaborating with other students, talking with Daniel and me when you need help, and generally by learning to google your way to answers.  There are many more ways accomplish a task than we will be able to teach you in this class.  Be open to exploring the other options available for completing a task.  It is likely that you will exceed our knowledge on a topic while working on your final project.  We will reward your creative thinking and resourcefulness with good grades.  Your reward for willingness to work hard, to be creative and resourceful will be a skillset that you will be able to use thought your career.

## Helping You Succeed & Creating an Inclusive Classroom Community

Daniel and I will be available to help you during class and during regular office hours.  __I will answer emails and other communications between the hours of 7 am – 7pm on weekdays.__  It is possible that I will get back to you weekends and evenings, but you should not expect a response during that time.

Daniel’s info…..

Students should also post questions to the group via the course GitHub.  Chances are that if you are having a problem, someone else may also have had the same problem.  Feel free to help each other succeed in this class!

Remember that we are all working towards the same goal; to getting better at programing. Sometimes this will involve learning skills, sometimes this will involve helping those around you learn a skill. Everyone in this course has a different level of programming expertise, and will bring a different skill set and unique perspective to the course. Please remember to be respectful when interacting with your peers, Daniel or me, because you never know what you might learn from talking with, helping, or collaborating  with other people.

We want you to feel respected as students. Along the same lines, we what to feel that you respect us as instructors and mentors. Keep in mind that every email sends more than one message. We know that you would never send the following email, but each member of the teaching team has at some point received a student email like this cartoon.

If you have concerns about the course content, the way that a topic is discussed, or any personal interactions in class, please contact Daniel or me.  We would like to mitigate any concerns as quickly as possible.  You will be given opportunities throughout the course to anonymously provide feedback regarding the course content, classroom community, and my effectiveness as an instructor. Please use these opportunities to give actionable criticism (i.e. something that can be improved upon).

UCLA’s Office for Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion provides resources, events, and information about current initiatives at UCLA to support equality for all members of the UCLA community. I hope that you will communicate with Daniel or me if you experience anything in this course that does not support an inclusive environment, and you can also report any incidents you may witness or experience on campus to the Office of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion on their website.

## How Your Learning Will Be Assessed (Grading Policy)
__Your grade will be assessed as follows:__

__Activity__ | __Percent Grade__
--- | ---
In class participation |	20%
Homework	|		10%
Lab assignments / participation	|		20%
Final Project	|		50%
__Total__ | __100%__

__Why I do not grade on a curve:__ <br>
In recent years, research into higher education assessment practices have shown that grading on a curve can create unnecessarily competitive environments for students and result in outcomes that disadvantage some groups of students over others. This is true in data collected and analyzed for our students at UCLA as well. For this reason, I do not grade on a curve. Your grade is therefore not based on how you did in comparison to your peers, but instead how successful you are at evidencing that you have mastered the intended learning goals for that specific assessment. However, if I do find that particular assessment questions I gave an assignment or exam were unreasonably challenging, unclear, or unfair for any reason I will  provide additional credit as appropriate. If you ever feel that an assignment or specific question is unfair or confusing please come and speak with me or your TA (ideally before it is due or during the assessment, but afterwards is okay also) so that we can address this concern as soon as possible. I am committed to making sure the assessment of your learning is comprehensive, fair, and incorporates best practices from education research on assessment design and inclusive practices.

__Grading Scale:__

Letter Grade | Percentage
--- | ---
A+ | 99-100%
A| 93%-98.9%
A-| 90%-92.9%
B+| 87%-89.9%

## Information About Our Course Assignments

__In class participation:__

You will work alone or in teams during class time to generate scripts, solve problems, and participate in class challenges. These activities are designed to test your understanding of your homework assignments and challenge you to think more creatively about programming. All in class activities must be turned in during class to the course GitHub. If you have an excused absence (criteria for an excused absence is detailed below), you will be given an alternate exercise.  The lowest in class assignment score will be dropped from your in-class participation grade.

__Homework:__

This course includes a broad range of topics and tools. Practice is the best way to learn how to program and homework assignments will prepare you for in class activities. Homework assignments will help you learn and master basic programming skills. Homework assignments will be submitted electronically before class. The submission cutoff is 7:45 am the day of class. Late submissions will be accepted but penalized 10% each day late (submitting 7:46 the day of class counts as 1 day late).

__Lab assignments / participation:__

You must attend computer lab. Computer lab assignments are designed to result in a practical product like a CV or website or to provide benchmarks and feedback on the final project. This is your opportunity to get immediate feedback on your final project and a good way to get personalized attention from Daniel.  All computer lab assignments must be turned in 15 minutes before your scheduled computer lab session.

__Final Project:__

The final project for this course will require you to produce software that manipulates and analyzes data.  This software must have a practical application for a current research project. If you do not currently have a research project will be paired with a researcher that has a computational need that is appropriate for the scope of the course and student group size.   Student group size will depend on the size of the program required for the research project and whether you are an undergraduate or a graduate student.

__Your final project will include and be evaluated based on the following criteria.__
* Cleaver or insightful program name.  Everyone loves a bad acronym.  
* Name and contact info for project members.
* Your Readme file.
* How well you justify the purpose of the program in the background / introduction of the readme.
* The clarity of the program workflow including the use dependencies.
* The instructions for running your program. The expected output of your program. The references cited in the readme.
* The completeness and effectiveness of scripts for accomplishing the research goal.  They can be written in Bash, Python, and or R.
* The clarity of the vignette for teaching the researcher to use the software and the presence of example data, example output, and run and error logs.

## Additional Course Policies and UCLA Policies

__Message about Academic Integrity to all UCLA Students from UCLA Dean of Students:__

UCLA is a community of scholars. In this community, all members including faculty, staff and students alike are responsible for maintaining standards of academic honesty. As a student and member of the University community, you are here to get an education and are, therefore, expected to demonstrate integrity in your academic endeavors. You are evaluated on your own merits. Cheating, plagiarism, collaborative work, multiple submissions without the permission of the professor, or other kinds of academic dishonesty are considered unacceptable behavior and will result in formal disciplinary proceedings usually resulting in suspension or dismissal.

__Forms of Academic Dishonesty:__

As specified in the UCLA Student Conduct Code, violations or attempted violations of academic dishonesty include, but are not limited to, __cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, multiple submissions or facilitating academic dishonesty:__

__Cheating:__ Unauthorized acquiring of knowledge of an examination or part of an examination
Allowing another person to take a quiz, exam, or similar evaluation for you
Using unauthorized material, information, or study aids in any academic exercise or examination – textbook, notes, formula list, calculator, etc.
Unauthorized collaboration in providing or requesting assistance, such as sharing information
Unauthorized use of someone else’s data in completing a computer exercise
Altering a graded exam or assignment and requesting that it be regraded

__Plagiarism:__ Presenting another’s words or ideas as if they were one’s own
Submitting as your own through purchase or otherwise, part of or an entire work produced verbatim by someone else
Paraphrasing ideas, data or writing without properly acknowledging the source
Unauthorized transfer and use of someone else’s computer file as your own
Unauthorized use of someone else’s data in completing a computer exercise

__Multiple Submissions:__ Submitting the same work (with exact or similar content) in more than one class without permission from the instructor to do so. This includes courses you are currently taking, as well as courses you might take in another quarter

__Facilitating Academic Dishonesty:__ Participating in any action that compromises the integrity if the academic standards of the University; assisting another to commit an act of academic dishonesty
Taking a quiz, exam, or similar evaluation in place of another person
Allowing another student to copy from you
Providing material or other information to another student with knowledge that such assistance could be used in any of the violations stated above (e.g., giving test information to students in other discussion sections of the same course)

__Fabrication:__ Falsification or invention of any information in an academic exercise
Altering data to support research
Presenting results from research that was not performed
Crediting source material that was not used for research

While you are here at UCLA, you may find yourself in a situation where cheating seems like a viable choice. You may rationalize to yourself that “Everyone else does it”…Well, they don’t. And will that matter when YOU get caught? NO! If you are unsure whether what you are considering doing is cheating, just ask yourself …how would you feel if your actions were public, for anyone to see? Would you feel embarrassed or ashamed? If the answer is yes, that’s a good indicator that you are taking a risk and rationalizing it to yourself.
If after reviewing the information above, you are still unclear about any of the items – don’t take chances, don’t just take your well-intentioned friend’s advice – ASK your TA or your Professor. Know the rules - Ignorance is NO defense. In addition, avoid placing yourself in situations which might lead your TA or Professor to suspect you of cheating. For example, during an exam don’t sit next to someone with whom you studied in case your answers end up looking “too similar.”

__Alternatives to Academic Dishonesty:__ 	

Seek out help – meet with your TA or Professor, ask if there is special tutoring available.
Drop the course – can you take it next quarter when you might feel more prepared and less pressured?
Ask for an extension – if you explain your situation to your TA or Professor, they might grant you an extended deadline.
See a counselor at Student Psychological Services, and/or your school, college or department – UCLA has many resources for students who are feeling the stresses of academic and personal pressures.

Remember, getting caught cheating affects more than just your GPA. How will you explain to your parents, family and friends that you have been suspended or dismissed? How will it affect your financial aid award and/or scholarship money? Will you be required to, and be able to pay back that money if you are no longer a student? If you live in the residence halls, where will you go if you are told you can no longer live there?

You have worked very hard to get here, so don’t cheat! If you would like more information, please come see us at the Dean of Students’ Office in 1206 Murphy Hall, call us at (310) 825-3871 or visit their website at www.deanofstudents.ucla.edu.
